Most insurance firms depend on human expertise and business rules-based software to protect themselves from fraud. However, people move on. And the drive for digital transformation and process automation means data and scenarios change faster than you can update the rules

>ML has the potential to allow insurers to move from the present state of **detect and react** to **predict and prevent**. Algorithms excels at automating the process of taking large volumes of data, analyzing multiple fraud indicators in parallel – which taken individually may often be quite normal – and finding potential fraud

## back story
Ideally, an agent would have the capacity to investigate each case and conclude whether it is genuine or fraud. However, this process is not only time consuming, but costly. Sourcing and funding the skilled labor required to review each of the thousands of claims that are filed a day is simply unfeasible

Traditional systems searched for *red flags*, otherwise known as fraudulent indicators. They are preprogrammed, meaning fraudulent claims had to fit into a particular template or else they would not be recognized. More advanced technologies have since been developed and allow for a more dynamic analysis of insurance claim data

## machine learning
ML is a part of Artificial Intelligence (Ai). The idea behind Ai is to create a system that can engage in complex analysis and not only replace human input but improve upon it. ML applies Ai and *gives* machines the ability to learn and improve from experience, with no extra programming. In order to do this, Ai analyze large, labeled datasets. Ai may take over menial tasks and free insurance agents to do more complex analysis

## technology inspired
Fraud risk detection is a knowledge-intensive activity that allows classifying correctly whether the claim is legitimate or fraudulent   

In the world of Data Science, there are a great number of other methodologies and algorithms that accurately leverage big data of users. Each of them has proven to effectively perform in some particular scenarios and situations. We divide them into two main scenarios depending on the available dataset:

>Use Case 1: The dataset has a sufficient number of fraud examples

In this case, classic ML or statistics-based techniques are applied to detect fraudulent transactions. This involves training a model or employing adequate algorithms to estimate transaction legitimacy

>Use Case 2: The dataset has no (or just a very little number of) fraud instances

In the case that none of any previous information on fraudulent transactions was stored, the learning model is built based on examples of legitimate transactions

### conclusion
Ai in the field of insurance fraud is to make it easier for human agents to find and investigate fraudulent claims and transactions, rather than sifting through tons of claims in an exhausting and time-consuming way

The use of advanced technology will increase the credibility of the insurer and, as a result, they would be able to establish better loyalty relationships with their clients
