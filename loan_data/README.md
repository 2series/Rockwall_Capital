## Back story
Effectively managing controls to support borrowers is now top of mind in our complex new world order and operating landscape. Financial institutions are challenged to operate efficiently and drive strong comprehensive controls amidst shifting risk

Globalization, intercompany trade, and mergers and acquisitions have increased the volume of transactions that impact the close. They’ve also created more silos and risk in downstream financial and regulatory reporting

In finance, loan instruments are the lending of money by one or more individuals, institutions, organizations or other entities to other individuals, organizations etc. The recipient (i.e. the borrower) incurs a debt, and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid, and also to repay the principal capital borrowed

>A loan in time enables the borrower to meet financial goals. At the same time, the interest associated with the loan generates revenues for the lender

However, there is always a risk associated with lending, especially in case of customers having insufficient or non-existent credit histories. If the borrower defaults on the loan, then that loan becomes a non-performing asset (or, NPA) for the lender. Any NPA hits the bottom-line of the lender

Therefore, every lender strives to assess the risk associated with the loan. Primarily, they want to assess their clients' repayment abilities well in advance before deciding on approval and disbursement of loans

## Spotlight on fraud risk
Failure to enforce controls, whether in finance or in broader parts of the organization, doesn’t just increase the risk of error. It increases the risk of fraud. Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) remains the most far-reaching response to financial scandals and has created new requirements to reduce fraud risk

>Section 302 of SOX requires a company’s “principal officers” to certify the integrity of financial reports quarterly, while Section 404 bolsters requirements that the company discloses any financial reporting controls deficiencies

Recent SEC cases have included:

* Actions focused on firms completely lacking internal controls
* Failure of individuals to comply with existing controls

With both organizations and individuals at risk, and increased external scrutiny, it’s never been more important to review the quality and implementation of the controls companies have put in place to stamp out financial irregularities and ensure that personnel have a comprehensive understanding of them

## Reconciliation automation to reduce fraud risk
Performing balance-sheet and bank reconciliations are standard procedures for preventing fraud risk, yet they are also one of the main reasons behind a slow close. Organizations often walk a tightrope between fraud risk, resource drain, or a sluggish financial close

Common issues include integrating data from internal and external sources, prioritizing between reconciling high-risk versus low-risk accounts and ensuring strong documentation trails

Automation and the application of data science enables organizations to integrate data more easily, apply matching rules at scale, auto-certify low-risk accounts, and focus effort on exceptions

### The goal of the code is to explore loan application data
