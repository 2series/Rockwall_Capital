Organizations with the best data scientists and learning algorithms have a significant competitive advantage. Professional data scientists use artificial narrow intelligence for massive advantage. Algorithms can add great value in certain circumstances within appropriate contexts and within data science processes

At this time there is NO artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is defined as Artificial intelligence (Ai) that is about equal to human intelligence. The problem is we cannot define human level intelligence and lack powerful enough compute, appropriate paradigms and algorithmic frameworks to make AGI at this time

Narrow Ai is getting stronger and smarter every day. Decisions based on data science evidence, learning algorithms, and human reasoning and creativity will make superior decisions over time *(most of the time, not all of the time)*

Building artificial narrow intelligence into data science processes can add massive value and advantage to achieve specific goals
