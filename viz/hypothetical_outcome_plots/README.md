## visual appearance and interactive behavior of a visualization

HOPs enable us to experiment with uncertainty in terms of countable events/transactions, just like we experience probability in our day to day lives

>From HOPs, we can infer variable dependencies as well as probabilities

### description versus experience
Interpreting visualizations of uncertainty may feel difficult and abstract. Why is this? For starters, most uncertainty presentations provide a static description of a probabilistic process. For example, error bars might convey a 95% confidence interval, standard error, or the standard deviation of a random variable. But contrast this for a moment with how we face uncertainty — the potential for multiple possible outcomes — in our day-to-day life. We want to eat at a restaurant but expect there might be a wait on certain nights. We know that the time it takes us to commute home can vary. We perceive sequences of events, and we build a sense of expectancy — or non-expectancy — specific to different types of events. Often, we don’t have to think much to do this. Intuition lets us take in a complex uncertain scenario and output a decision quickly and often with confidence

>Intuition is not, however, magical. It arises from a stream of past experiences, with similarities to new situations in which we need to act
